title: "A city full of design"

To open up creative processes and give scope for experimentation on-site, are
the core elements of the VIENNA DESIGN WEEK, Austriaâ€™s largest design festival.

During the event, which entered this year its 11th edition, the Austrian
capital became a showcase for a diversity of creative manifestations.

The philosophy of the platform defines design, more than just a designed object,
as an essential part of the cultural production that shapes our every-day life
and our world as consumers.

Thus, this photo gallery seeks to show the way in which design connects us to
each other, addresses and analyze social issues and, most of all, influences
our aesthetic senses and judgements.
