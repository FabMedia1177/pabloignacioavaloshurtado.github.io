title: "Between Austria and Mexico"
---

It was in 2009, during a trip to the state of Oaxaca, Mexico when he had his
first encounter with the black pottery handicrafts, without knowing that it
would turn into the motivation that leads him to work hand in hand with local
workshops and artisans.

His name is David Pompa, a designer whose proposals break the border between
the traditional and contemporary processes.

While this creator was born in Austria, his Mexican background generated him
a strong connection with the Latin American culture. Perhaps, this reveals why
his creations blend various crafts techniques with the pure lines that define
European design.

“The Mexican market is proud to acquire national work,” states the founder of
the namesake brand that opened in 2013 his first store in the trendy district
Roma, in the capital of Mexico. “For this reason, we support this trend by
developing eclectic pieces that respect and drive the country heritage to a
higher quality level.”

Along with his interdisciplinary studio based in Klagenfurt, Austria, the
author gives life to plenty of accessories such as chairs, lamps (pendant,
wall, floor and table) and vases, among others, endowed with attributes like
LED light bulbs that provide environmentally friendly items.

“As a result, each object challenges the production mechanisms to provide
solutions that capture the essence of the national identity translated into a
modern language,” points out the designer who introduced in October a temporary
Pop-Up Shop at the Artek Helsinki Store, in Finland.

Thereby, a wide range of innovative concepts emerges from materials that
include polished copper and brass, hand-blown glass and recycled PVC, all of
them expressed in collections like Cometa, La Trufa, or La Caleta which possess
a unique personality that permeates of vitality to any space.
